## 📊 Project Workflow  

### **Phase 1 – Excel Analysis**
- Cleaned raw data for missing or invalid values.  
- Applied **conditional formatting** to highlight high-risk customers based on payment delays.  
- Built **pivot tables** and **charts** summarizing:
  - Default rate by education and age group  
  - Credit limit distributions  
  - Gender and marital status-based insights 

---

### **Phase 2 – Python Modeling**
- Imported and cleaned the dataset using **Pandas & NumPy**.  
- Performed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
  - Distribution of credit limits and ages  
  - Relationship between default status and features  
- Encoded categorical data and scaled numerical values.  
- Built predictive models using **Scikit-learn**, such as:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Random Forest**
- Evaluated model accuracy, recall, and confusion matrix.  
- Exported cleaned dataset for Tableau:

### **Phase 3 – Tableau Dashboard**
- Connected the cleaned CSV data to Tableau.  
- Created **3 KPI cards**:
  - 📊 *Overall Default Rate (22.1%)*
  - 💰 *Average Credit Limit*
  - 👥 *Total Customers*
- Built **4 Analytical Charts**:
  1. Default Rate by Gender  
  2. Default Rate by Education  
  3. Average Credit Limit by Default Status  
  4. Default Rate by Age Group  

- Combined all visuals into a professional dashboard:
  - Filtered by Gender and Age Group  
  - Color-coded for Defaulted vs. Non-defaulted users  
  - Interactive insights for business stakeholders

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings  

- **Default Rate:** ~22.1% of customers are at risk of default.  
- **Risk Segments:** Certain **age** and **gender** groups show higher default tendencies.  
- **Credit Limit Trends:** Non-defaulted users tend to have **higher average credit limits**.  
- **Business Impact:**  
  - Supports **risk-based pricing** and **collection strategy**.  
  - Helps monitor the **credit portfolio health** and identify risky customer profiles.
